## Skeleton Framework

An easy to use, responsive boilerplate. It's easy to start and requires no installation. 
It has a built in grid system very similar to bootstrap, based on columns of 12 that span 960 px.

Skeleton has a number of small utility classes that act as easy-to-use helpers. Sometimes it's better to use a utility class than create a whole new class just to float an element.
