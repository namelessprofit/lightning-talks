## Skeleton Framework

An easy to use, responsive boilerplate. It's easy to start and requires no installation. 
It has a built in grid system very similar to bootstrap, based on columns of 12 that span 960 px.

Skeleton has a number of small utility classes that act as easy-to-use helpers. Sometimes it's better to use a utility class than create a whole new class just to float an element.

## Media Queries

Skeleton uses media queries to serve its scalable grid, but also has a list of queries for convenience of styling your site across devices. The queries are mobile-first, meaning they target min-width. Mobile-first queries are how Skeleton's grid is built and is the preferrable method of organizing CSS. It means all styles outside of a query apply to all devices, then larger devices are targeted for enhancement. This prevents small devices from having to parse tons of unused CSS. The sizes for the queries are:

## Typography

Type is all set with the rems, so font-sizes and spacial relationships can be responsively sized based on a single <html> font-size property. Out of the box, Skeleton never changes the <html> font-size, but it's there in case you need it for your project. All measurements are still base 10 though so, an h1 tag with 5.0remfont-size just means 50px. 
The typography base is Raleway served by Google, set at 15rem (15px) over a 1.6 line height (24px). Other type basics like anchors, strong, emphasis, and underline are all obviously included.

Headings create a family of distinct sizes each with specific letter-spacing, line-height, and margins.
